## About
A script to calculate the Levenshtein distance using the Wagner-Fischer algorithm.

From Wikipedia:

"In information theory, linguistics, and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other."

"The Wagnerâ€“Fischer algorithm computes edit distance based on the observation that if we reserve a matrix to hold the edit distances between all prefixes of the first string and all prefixes of the second, then we can compute the values in the matrix by flood filling the matrix, and thus find the distance between the two full strings as the last value computed."
